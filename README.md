# inline-search-chrome-ext

**NOTE:** Not in active development.

This extension allows users to perform searches or look-ups in arbitrary engines without
leaving the page. Searches are performed by holding a key and double-clicking a word, or
selecting it. A small inline box pops up with the results. The extension works for any
search engine or online dictionary, and allows users to specify their own choices.

A little useful feature is the ability to specify default scrolling actions for each
source, so when a search is performed, the pop-up will automatically scroll to the
appropriate section of the page.
